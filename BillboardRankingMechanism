The Billboard Hot 100 has a formula.  They track airplay on about a thousand terrestrial radio stations (AM/FM radio in the USA).  Digital download song sales and physical singles sales (data from Nielsen SoundScan) is factored in.  Radio airplay and sales are the ingredients that carry the most weight in the formula.

Just added to the Hot 100 formula is the streaming data that makes up Billboardâ€™s new On-Demand Songs Chart (song plays from MOG, Muve Music, Rdio, Rhapsody, Slacker and Spotify), as well as plays on non-demand radio streams from Rhapsody and Slacker. The Hot 100 chart rankings formula now also includes plays on video request service Akoo and audio on-demand streams from MySpace and Guvera.

All these methods earn a song points which are weighted in a points system, and added together.  More points equals higher rank in the Hot 100 [1][2].

As we wrote in January when YouTube data was added to the Hot 100's equation: "Generally speaking, our Hot 100 formula targets a ratio of sales (35-45%), airplay (30-40%) and streaming (20-30%).".Of course, that's an overall target for 100 songs each week. That mark can change week-to-week. This week, though, the Hot 100 breaks down in line with the formula's intent: sales, 39%; airplay, 34%; and, streaming, 27%.

And, week-to-week, some songs show largely along those percentages, while others skew noticeably toward any of the chart's three metrics [3].
